    <p>Here are some of my favorites and to-watch movies when I feel a bit down.</p>

    <h2 class="m1">1. Begin Again</h2>

      <p class="content1">Starring Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo, the duo shows off an amazing rendition of jazzy music and also the
        conflicts beautifully. Gretta (Keira Knightley) and her long-time boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine) are college sweethearts and songwriting partners who decamp for New York when he lands a deal with a major label.
        But the trappings of his new-found fame soon tempt Dave to stray, and a reeling, lovelorn Gretta is left on her own. Her world takes a turn for the better when Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a disgraced record-label exec,
        stumbles upon her performing on an East Village stage and is immediately captivated by her raw talent. From this chance encounter emerges an enchanting portrait of a mutually transformative collaboration, set to the soundtrack of a summer in
        New York City.
        <br><br>
        With great songs as a bonus.

      <p class="content2">Two young girls, 10-year-old Satsuki and her 4-year-old sister Mei, move into a house in the
        country with their father to be closer to their hospitalized mother. Satsuki and Mei discover that the nearby forest is inhabited by magical
        creatures called Totoros (pronounced toe-toe-ro). They soon befriend these Totoros, and have several magical adventures.
        As the girls grow acquainted with rural life, Mei encounters a small, bunny-like creature in the yard one day.
        Chasing it into the forest, she finds "Totoro"—a giant, mystical forest spirit whom she soon befriends. Before long, Satsuki too meets Totoro,
        and the two girls suddenly find their lives filled with magical adventures in nature and fantastical creatures of the woods.<br><br>
        Truly my comfort movie.
