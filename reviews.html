    <h1>Laras' Watched Movies</h1>
    <p>Here are some of my favorites and to-watch movies when I feel a bit down.</p>

  <div class="beginagain">
    <h2 class="m1">1. Begin Again</h2>
    <div class="divi">

      <p class="content1">Starring Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo, the duo shows off an amazing rendition of jazzy music and also the
        conflicts beautifully. Gretta (Keira Knightley) and her long-time boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine) are college sweethearts and songwriting partners who decamp for New York when he lands a deal with a major label.
        But the trappings of his new-found fame soon tempt Dave to stray, and a reeling, lovelorn Gretta is left on her own. Her world takes a turn for the better when Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a disgraced record-label exec,
        stumbles upon her performing on an East Village stage and is immediately captivated by her raw talent. From this chance encounter emerges an enchanting portrait of a mutually transformative collaboration, set to the soundtrack of a summer in
        New York City.
        <br><br>
        With great songs as a bonus.

      <p class="content2">Two young girls, 10-year-old Satsuki and her 4-year-old sister Mei, move into a house in the
        country with their father to be closer to their hospitalized mother. Satsuki and Mei discover that the nearby forest is inhabited by magical
        creatures called Totoros (pronounced toe-toe-ro). They soon befriend these Totoros, and have several magical adventures.
        As the girls grow acquainted with rural life, Mei encounters a small, bunny-like creature in the yard one day.
        Chasing it into the forest, she finds "Totoro"—a giant, mystical forest spirit whom she soon befriends. Before long, Satsuki too meets Totoro,
        and the two girls suddenly find their lives filled with magical adventures in nature and fantastical creatures of the woods.<br><br>
        Truly my comfort movie.

  <div class="forrest">
    <h2 class="m3">3. Forrest Gump</h2>
    <div class="divi">
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61f-3U6q1UL._AC_SL1068_.jpg" alt="forrestcover" width="200px">
      <p class="content3">Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low I.Q. but good intentions. He is running through childhood with his
        best and only friend Jenny. His 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny.
        Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he wins medals,
        creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the smiley,
        writes bumper stickers and songs, donates to people and meets the president several times. However, this is all
        irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, who has messed up her life.
        Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.
        <br><br>
        I guess this movie just sums up some people's life.

    <h2 class="m4">4. August Rush</h2>
    <div class="divi">
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDIwNjE3NjU2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ2NjQzMw@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg" alt="augustcover" width="200px">
      <p class="content4">12 years ago, on a moonlit rooftop above Washington Square, sheltered young cellist
        Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and charismatic Irish singer/songwriter Louise Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers)
        were drawn together by a street musician's rendition of ''Moondance'' and fell in love. After the most romantic
        night of her life, Lyla promised to meet Louis again, but despite her protests, her father rushed her to her next
        concert--leaving Louis to believe that she didn't care. Disheartened, he found it impossible to continue playing
        and eventually abandoned his music while Lyla, her own hopes for love lost, was led to believe months later that
        she had also lost their unborn child in a car accident. Their orphaned son (Freddie Highmore) uses his musical
        talent as a clue to find his birth parents.
        <br> <br>
        This movie successfully bawled my eyes out in my English lesson on seventh grade.
